A simple build tool for ALICE experiment software and its externals. Recipes
for the externals and ALICE software are stored in
[alidist](https://github.com/alisw/alidist).

Install with:

    pip install alibuild

On macOS you can also install with:

    brew tap alisw/system-deps
    brew install alisw/system-deps/alibuild

Instant gratification on your machine with:

    git clone https://github.com/alisw/alidist.git
    aliBuild build AliRoot

For a more verbose documentation of what is happening have a look at
the [quickstart guide](quick.html). See the [user guide](user.html)
for more command line options or have a look at the [troubleshooting
pages](troubleshooting.html) for hints on how to debug build errors.
Have a look at the [reference guide](reference.html) if you want to
package your own software.

    <div class="pure-u-1-3"><h3>Simple build recipes</h3>
      Build recipes are simple bash scripts with a YAML header. Whenever
      a dependency or a package changes only what is affected by the
      change is rebuilt.

    <div class="pure-u-1-3"><h3>Reuses system tools</h3>
      If desired, aliBuild will do its best to reuse what is available
      on the system, if compatible to what is found in the recipe.

    <div class="pure-u-1-3"><h3>Docker support</h3>
      aliBuild allows builds to happen inside a docker container, so
      that you can develop on Mac and build on your production Linux
      platform.

    <div class="pure-u-1-3"><h3>Binary packages</h3>
      aliBuild provides the ability to reuse binary packages which were

      built locally.
