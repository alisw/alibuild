Valid substitutions are:</p> <ul> <li><code>%(branch_basename)s</code>: the name of the current alidist branch, without     the leading <code>refs/heads/</code>.</li> <li><code>%(branch_stream)s</code>: in case the alidist branch ends in <code>-patches</code>, the     name of branch without <code>-patches</code>. If the branch does not end in     <code>-patches</code>, the <code>tag</code> field of the recipe is used.</li> <li><code>%(commit_hash)s</code>: if the <code>tag</code> field is a git tag, then the tag name.

It's good practice to make sure that they are already patched, so that you     can easily point to the actual sources used by the software.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>write_repo</code>: in case the repository URL to be used for developing is     different from the <code>source</code>, set this key. It is used by <code>aliBuild init</code>,     which will initialise your local repository with the <code>upstream</code> remote     pointing at this URL instead of the one in <code>source</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>tag</code>: git reference in the above mentioned repository which points to the     software to be built. This can be a tag name, a branch name or a commit     hash.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>env</code>: dictionary whose key-value pairs are environment variables to be set     after the recipe is built. The values are interpreted as the contents of a     double-quoted shell string, so you can reference other environment variables     as <code>$VARIABLE</code>, which will be substituted each time another recipe is built.     For example:</p> <pre><code>env:\n  \"$ROOTSYS\": $ROOT_ROOT\n</code></pre> <p>These variables will not be available in the recipe itself, as they are intended to be used to point to build products of the current recipe. If you need to set an environment variable for use in the recipe, use <code>export VARIABLE=value</code> in the recipe body.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>prepend_path</code>: dictionary whose key-value pairs are an environment variable     name and a path to be prepended to it, as it happens in <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.     This happens only after the package declaring the <code>prepend_path</code> in question     is built, so it is not available in the same recipe (just like variables     declared using <code>env</code>). You can append multiple paths to a single variable     by specifying a list too, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>prepend_path:\n  \"PATH\": \"$FOO_ROOT/binexec/foobar\"\n  \"LD_LIBRARY_PATH\": [ \"$FOO_ROOT/sub/lib\", \"$FOO_ROOT/sub/lib64\" ]\n</code></pre> <p>will result in prepending <code>$FOO_ROOT/binexec/foobar</code> to <code>$PATH</code>, and both <code>$FOO_ROOT/sub/lib</code> and <code>lib64</code> to <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>append_path</code>: same as <code>prepend_path</code> but paths are appended rather than     prepended. Like <code>append_path</code> and <code>env</code>, this does not affect the     environment of the current recipe.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>requires</code>: a list of run-time dependencies for the package, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>package: AliRoot\nrequires:\n  - ROOT\n  ...\n</code></pre> <p>The specified dependencies will be built before building the given package. You can specify platform-specific dependencies by appending <code>:&lt;regexp&gt;</code> to the dependency name. Similarly, you can specify build default specific dependencies by appending <code>:defaults=&lt;regex&gt;</code>.</p> <p>Such a regular expression will be matched against the architecture provided via <code>--architecture</code>, and if it does not match, the requirement will not be included. For instance:</p> <pre><code>package: AliRoot-test\nrequires:\n  - \"igprof:(?!osx).*\"\n</code></pre> <p>will make sure that <code>IgProf</code> is only built on platforms whose name does not begin with <code>osx</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>build_requires</code>: a list of build-time dependencies for the package. Like     <code>requires</code>, these packages will be built before the current package is     built.</p> <p>Packages in this list are marked specially in the dependency graph produced by <code>aliBuild deps</code>. Other tools treat these packages differently from <code>requires</code>: for instance, RPMs produced for a package won't depend on its <code>build_requires</code>, and <code>alibuild-generate-module</code> won't pull in build requirements' modulefiles.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>force_rebuild</code>: set it to <code>true</code> to force re-running the build recipe every     time you invoke alibuild on it.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>prefer_system_check</code>: a script which is used to determine whether     or not the system equivalent of the package can be used. See also     <code>prefer_system</code>. If the <code>--no-system</code> option is specified, this key is not     checked. The shell exit code is used to steer the build: if the check     returns 0, the system package is used and the recipe is not run. If it     returns non-zero, our own version of the package is built through the     recipe.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>prefer_system</code>: a regular expression for architectures which should     use the <code>prefer_system_check</code> by default to determine if the system version     of the tool can be used. When the rule matches, the result of     <code>prefer_system_check</code> determines whether to build the recipe. When the rule     does not match, the check is skipped and the recipe is run. Using the switch     <code>--always-prefer-system</code> runs the check always (even when the regular     expression for the architecture does not match).</p> </li> <li> <p><code>relocate_paths</code>: a list of toplevel paths scanned recursively to perform     relocation of executables and dynamic libraries on macOS only. If not     specified, defaults to <code>bin</code>, <code>lib</code> and <code>lib64</code>.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"reference.html#the-body","title":"The body","text":"<p>This is the build script executed to effectively build and install your software.

In certain cases, to ensure full compatibility on what is done in production it might be desirable to always pick up our own version of the tools. This can be done by passing the <code>--no-system</code> option to alibuild. On the other hand, there might be cases in which you want to pick up not only basic tools, but also advanced ones like ROOT, Geant4, or Pythia from the system, either to save time or because you have a pre-existing setup which you do not want to touch.
